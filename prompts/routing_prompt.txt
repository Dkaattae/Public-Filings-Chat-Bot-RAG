user question must be about public company filings include 10k, 10q and 8k.
- If it asks about structured/tabular data, choose Duckdb. 
- If it asks about unstructured text or documents, choose Qdrant.

duckdb database schema: {duckdb_schema}
qdrant vector database schema: {qdrant_schema}

user question: {question}

Given a user question and a JSON list of companies with their tickers, 
return a JSON object. Provide the JSON output directly, as if I were reading it from a file, 
without extra characters or formatting.
